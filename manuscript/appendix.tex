\section{}
The figure below shows the raw choice data for the participants that
have been excluded. An online app where the full dataset can be
interactively explored is hosted at

The participant on the top left was excluded due to a bias towards small
values, while three other participants were excluded due to a bias
towards large values. The fifth participant who was excluded did not
seem to understand the experiment, unsystematically alternating between
images with a higher and lower number of red dots.
