    <div class="instructions well">

      <p>During this experiment, you'll see a statement by some character and two pictures on each trial. Please select the picture which you think the speaker could have had in mind when uttering the statement.</p>

      <p>There will be 50 pairs of pictures for each utterance. After 50 selections, the statement changes, but the task otherwise stays the same. You will see 4 different statements. The experiment usually takes no longer than 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>In some cases, you might think that the speaker may have had both pictures in mind when she made the statement, or neither. In such cases, just select a picture a speaker could have had in mind on some occasion. In other words, try to select pictures with an eye to how frequently they may be what speakers have in mind when they make an utterance, not what an ideal speaker should most likely have in mind.</p>

      <p>We are interested in your spontaneous responses, so don't think too long before answering. Thanks!</p>
